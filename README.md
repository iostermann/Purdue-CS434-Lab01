# This is an OpenGL project that I completed for advanced graphics at purdue in spring 2021. 
Here is the text from the readme that I put in my final submission:

# Purdue-CS434-Lab01

To the best of my interpretation, all the Lab1 tasks were implemented as well as 
	all of the extra credit tasks except for making windmills shoot back.

Camera is Quake style i.e. forward, backward, rotation. No strafing.
Colors for bullets and windmills are taken from reference values for chrome and pewter.
When you shoot, the lighting effect is that everything turns yellow for a few frames.
When you hit a windmill blade, that windmill turns red and yellow for a few frames.
Bullets per scene is unlimited, fire away!
